=head1 SYNOPSIS

 clad [-n] [-a] [-l user] <cluster> <command>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Clad provides the ability to run the same command on several hosts at 
once.  The output is displayed unbuffered as the various hosts run the 
command.  The list of hosts is determined by reading a configuration file
which may also contain command aliases and environment settings.

The command(s) will be executed under '/bin/sh -e' regardless of the 
login shell for the remote user.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item -n

Dry run, just show the command that would be executed and each host.

=item -a

Do not colorize the host names in the output.

=item -l user

Specify a login name for all ssh connections.

=item --verbose

Print out a lot of debugging information which may be useful in debugging issues with clad.

=item --serial

Force clad to wait for the command to finish on each host before continuing to the next.  This
will be slower, but may be easier to read the output.

=item --help

Print help and exit.

=item --version

Print the version and exit.

=back

=head1 ENVIRONMENT

=head2 CLAD_CLUSTER

This environment variable is set to the cluster name from the 
configuration file on each node that the command is run.  The deprecated
C<CLUSTER> is also set, though that may be removed in a future version.
