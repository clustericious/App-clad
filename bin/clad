=head1 SYNOPSIS

 clad [-n] [-a] [-l user] <cluster> <command>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Clad provides the ability to run the same command on several hosts at 
once.  The output is displayed unbuffered as the various hosts run the 
command.  The list of hosts is determined by reading a configuration file
which may also contain command aliases and environment settings.

The command(s) will be executed under '/bin/sh -e' regardless of the 
login shell for the remote user.
