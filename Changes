  - As promised, older configuration keys aliases and clusters has been removed

1.06      2015-12-16 15:13:04 -0500
  - Allow hostname as single host cluster.
  - Added --list option

1.05      2015-12-03 13:38:41 -0500
  - Added the --summary option
  - Added the --log, --log-dir and --purge options
  - Colorize failure and stderr (colors are configurable via fail_color and
    err_color configuration items)

1.04      2015-11-29 12:57:14 -0500
  - If STDIN is not a tty, then it will be read and
    passed onto the server.
  - Moved repository to clustericious org on github
    (updated meta appropriately)

1.03      2015-11-27 09:41:40 -0500
  - Added the --dir option
    (requires server 1.02)
  - Use Data::Dumper as fallback instead of JSON::PP.
    Thus in theory should work with a core Perl 5.6.x 
    server side.

1.02      2015-11-25 17:55:03 -0500
  - Internal performance tweaks

1.01      2015-11-25 21:42:53 +0000
  - Added the --file option
    (requires server 1.01)
  - Added script configuration item

1.00      2015-11-17 04:57:07 -0500
  - Minor documentation fixes, otherwise identical to
    the 0.99_05 release.

0.99_05   2015-11-16 20:52:07 -0500
  - Second release candidate for 1.00
  - Added --fat option (and fat config option) for
    hosts that don't already have App-clad installed
  - Relaxed requirement for server code (using --fat)
    to Perl 5.8 and JSON::PP.
  - Added --max option.

0.99_04   2015-11-16 06:57:26 -0500
  - Consider this to be a release candidate for 1.00
  - Stop argument parsing at first non-option,
    non recognized option, so arguments can be passed
    to remote end without -- (this fixes an issue
    mostly relevent since 0.99_01, which was a trial
    release anyway).

0.99_03   2015-11-16 04:27:10 -0500
  - Deprecate "clusters" in the configuration file
    in favor of "cluster".  "clusters" will be removed
    on or after January 31, 2016.
  - Restored the now deprecated (instead of removed)
    Clustericious::Admin interface.  Along with the
    other deprecations I plan on removing it on or
    after January 31, 2016.
  - MSWin32 is officially not supported.  It may be in
    a future revision.

0.99_02   2015-11-14 01:38:10 -0500
  - Added ssh_extra configuration useful for
    appending to ssh_options
  - Deprecate "aliases" in the configuration file
    in favor of "alias".  "aliases" will be removed
    on or after January 31, 2016.
  - Added some server side verification of payload.

0.99_01   2015-11-13 22:04:58 -0500
  - Complete rewrite from scratch.  List
    of (probably not exhaustive) changes
    to follow.
  - No support for macros.  These seem to have been
    documented in Clustericious::Admin, but
    not actually implemented.
  - Use of single argument or list version of
    system on the server side.  See EXAMPLES 
    for details.
  - Environment variables are more accurately passed
    to the server side when you are using shell
    logic operators (||, &&, etc) pipes ( | ).
  - Clustericious::Admin is no longer a public interface
    to clad.  It wasn't ever really inteded to be so,
    but it did include some documentation.  A public
    interface may be added here later.
  - Clustericious::Admin is an empty package included
    for dependency compatibility only.  The machinery
    for the app has been moved into App::clad.
  - App::clad and the clad executable is used on both
    the client AND the server.  This makes it more
    reliable, but does require that it be installed on
    both hosts, where before it only needed to be
    on the client.
  - This implementation uses AnyEvent::Open3::Simple and
    is object oriented to make the code easier to maintain.
