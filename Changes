  - Complete rewrite from scratch.  List
    of (probably not exhaustive) changes
    to follow.
  - No support for macros.  These seem to have been
    documented in Clustericious::Admin, but
    not actually implemented.
  - Use of single argument or list version of
    system on the server side.  See EXAMPLES 
    for details.
  - Environment variables are more accurately passed
    to the server side when you are using shell
    logic operators (||, &&, etc) pipes ( | ).
  - Clustericious::Admin is no longer a public interface
    to clad.  It wasn't ever really inteded to be so,
    but it did include some documentation.  A public
    interface may be added here later.
  - Clustericious::Admin is an empty package included
    for dependency compatibility only.  The machinery
    for the app has been moved into App::clad.
  - App::clad and the clad executable is used on both
    the client AND the server.  This makes it more
    reliable, but does require that it be installed on
    both hosts, where before it only needed to be
    on the client.
  - This implementation uses AnyEvent::Open3::Simple and
    is object oriented to make the code easier to maintain.
